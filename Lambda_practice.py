# Consider the list: 

prog_lang = [('Python', 3.8), ('Java', 13), ('JavaScript', 2019), ('Scala', 2.13)]

# 1. Sort the list by each language's version in ascending order.
sort_list = 
# 2. Sort the list by the length of the name of each language in descending order.

# 3. Filter the list so that it only contains languages with 'a' in it.

# 4. Filter the list so that it only contains languages whose version is in integer form.
